ModCore is a Discord bot with a wide range of features, mostly centered around server management. Here's a list of everything ModCore can do for you.

### Ban Members
ModCore can ban members in a variety of ways.
- Permanent Ban
- Temporary Ban
- Hackban (ban members that are not in your server)

Members that get banned from your server via ModCore get notified of their (temporary) ban via DM. This doesn't apply to Hackbans.

Bans can also be listed via a separate command.

### Kick Members
ModCore can also kick members in two different ways
- Regular Kick
- Softban (Bans a member and unbans them right after. This will remove their message like a ban would.)

Members that get kicked also get notified of their removal.

### Mute Members
ModCore can (temporarily) mute members. It will automatically set up a mute role for you if one hasn't been set.

### Schedule actions
ModCore can schedule specific actions for you. These actions include:
- Plan message pin
- Plan message unpin

### Community management
ModCore helps making community management very easy. Things you can do include:
- Announce messages to roles
- Create reaction polls
- Build messages (with embeds)
- Quote messages
- Set up roles members can assign to themselves
- Grant roles on reactions
- Set a welcome message
- Grant roles to new members
- Remember member roles. This will give roles back to members that rejoin.
- Filter nasty links or invites from chat

### Starboard
With ModCore, you can set up your own starboard with a custom reaction emoji. This is a nice way to show your appreciation to your friend's shitty meme!

### Disable specific commands
With ModCore you can disable specific commands from usage.

### Logging
With ModCore you can log various things. This includes:
- Commands that failed (can be logged to chat as well as a channel)
- Members joining / leaving to a channel
- Log moderator actions to a webhook.

### Suggest commands on typo
ModCore can (try to) predict what command you wanted to execute when you make a typo.

### Custom prefix
ModCore supports custom prefixes. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### ModNotes
You can use ModCore to attach moderator notes to members. These can be accessed by other moderators as well.

### Reminders
With ModCore you can set reminders. Need to remind yourself to do something? This is a great way to do so!

### Tags
With ModCore you can create tags. These tags have a name, which will return text linked to that name. You can also transfer existing tags to other members, copy them to other channels or show information about the tag and it's creator. Tags are linked to channels but can be accessed from other channels as well.

### Request Nickname Change
For picky server owners, you can force all your members to go through an approval process for changing their nicknames. Seize the names of production!

### Info
ModCore can collect information about various subjects. This includes:
- Information on users
- Information on channels
- Information on roles
- Information on the server

### Purge Messages
ModCore can purge messages based on on a couple of things:
- All messages
- Messages by a specific user
- Commands
- Bots
- Images and/or attachments
- Regex (advanced users)

### Calculate toxicity
ModCore can calculate a member's toxicity. This is done using the private Perspective API by Google.

More information on this API can be found here: [Click!](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) We're still experimenting with this.

### Future additions
We're always happy to add new features to ModCore to make your experiences even better. If you have any requests, first check whether a request has been made yet, then open an issue if your feature hasn't been requested before.
